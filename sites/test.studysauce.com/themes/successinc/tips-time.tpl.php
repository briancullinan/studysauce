<h2>Time management study tips</h2>

        <h4>Cramming</h4>
        <p>Cramming does tend to produce short term results, however, the brain has a tendency to “dump” the information after the test.  You will end up having to restudy the material to commit it to long term memory…which can be problematic for your Final Exams…  Not to mention the fact that the material you are studying will most likely need to be used again in a more advanced course.</p>

    <div>
        <h4>Pulling all-nighters</h4>
        <p>The hallmark of poor time management is the all-nighter.  Although it is often paraded as a badge of honor, it is very clearly a terrible study habit.  All-nighters are bad for your brain.  Sleep is a critical mechanism for your brain to repair itself and by interfering with your sleep cycle, you reduce attention span, memory retention, and recall ability (among many other things).  Additionally, all-nighters are linked to lower GPAs in academic performance research.</p>

        <h4>Procrastinating</h4>
        <p>"I work better under pressure."  Most of us either believe this or have friends that recite this mantra.  Unfortunately, the research shows that this is simply not true.  Heavy procrastinators are linked to lower grades.  There are several tips we can offer to help limit your procrastination, but you will have to find what works best for you.  Here are some of our favorite methods are 1) Take the first step and 2) Set aside time to study.  Read on to learn more about this.</p>

        <h4>Take the first step</h4>
        <p>Productivity gurus commonly emphasize the importance of taking the very first step.  This simple piece of advice is powerful for a few reasons.  First, big projects can be overwhelming if you look at them from afar.  It is critical to think of them as a group of smaller, more manageable problems.  Once you do that, it becomes much easier to get started.  Second, once you get started, you will often be surprised by how quickly things go.  The faster you take the first step, the faster you get started, the faster you finish.  Try this - think about the very first thing you need to do to get started.  Then do it.</p>

        <h4>Set aside time to study</h4>
        <p>College is full of distractions.  You can always find great reasons to push off studying to a later time.  By designating specific time for studying, you can force yourself to overlook many distractions.  We highly recommend building a study schedule (and will build one for you if you upgrade to premium).  Think through where and when you want to study and commit to it ahead of time.  This prior commitment is key to fighting off distractions and will help reduce procrastination.</p>

        <h4>Write down your key deadlines</h4>
        <p>Get organized by writing down the deadlines for all of your classes.  This will help you get a better sense of the ebbs and flows of your schedule.  There will likely be weeks that have quite a few deadlines, and you can save yourself some pain by spotting these busy weeks ahead of time.  Check out our key <a href="#deadlines">deadlines tool</a> to help you plan ahead and set up notifications.</p>

        <h4>Create a midterm or finals study schedule</h4>
        <p>The few weeks before midterms and finals can be very stressful.  We recommend creating a detailed schedule of your exams/papers/etc. and penciling in what material you want to cover ahead of each exam.  This exercise will get you started thinking on how much studying you will need to do, and will help you allocate enough time to study sufficiently for each topic.</p>
