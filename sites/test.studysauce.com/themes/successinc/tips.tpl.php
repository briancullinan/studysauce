    <h3>Good study habits</h3>
    <div><img width="48" height="48" src="/<?php print drupal_get_path('theme', 'successinc'); ?>/images/Ico%20Location%202.png">
        <h4>Alternating study location</h4>
        <p>Changing location has shown a significant improvement in memory retention in studies done by cognitive scientists.&nbsp; According to the researchers, the brain associates the material being learned with the environment that the studier is in.&nbsp; Varied environments allow the brain more opportunities to associate the material with something unique - which in turn increases the likelihood of retention.<!--<a onclick="jQuery(this).parent().parent().toggleClass('read-more'); return false;" href="#">Read more</a></p>

        <h4>Studying multiple subjects during the same session</h4>
        <p>Think of this as athletics for your brain.&nbsp; Elite athletes have been cross-training in multiple disciplines for years because of the proven benefits of varied activity.&nbsp; The brain is also a muscle and studies have shown that retention of study material improves dramatically when different parts of the brain are activated.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the brain must use different approaches to solving problems, it is better able to solve varied problems that a student is likely to encounter on a test.&nbsp; Results of scientific studies have shown double the performance of test takers focusing on a single subject and has been corroborated using both adults and children.&nbsp; This is most effective if you study very different types of courses as opposed to similar ones.&nbsp; For example, alternating Spanish with Calculus will be more effective than alternating Economics with Statistics.&nbsp;</p>

    <div><img width="64" height="64" src="/<?php print drupal_get_path('theme', 'successinc'); ?>/images/Ico%20No%20Phone.png">
        <h4>Ditching the cell phone</h4>
        <p>Your cell phone is your enemy when it comes to studying.&nbsp; If you are like us, severing your electronic umbilical cord is extraordinarily tough to do.&nbsp; If you have a smartphone, put it on airplane mode in order to avoid any distractions.&nbsp; The texts and calls can wait…promise.&nbsp; This obviously goes for tablets, ipods, kindles, laptops, and anything else that will draw your attention away from the task at hand.</p>
    </div>
    <div><img width="64" height="64" src="/<?php print drupal_get_path('theme', 'successinc'); ?>/images/Ico%20Take%20Breaks.png">
        <h4>Taking breaks</h4>
        <p>This will ultimately be a personal preference.&nbsp; A good rule of thumb is to study hard for 50 minutes, then take a 10 minute break.&nbsp; You can then repeat the process for days that you need to study longer.&nbsp; There is a lot of conflicting research in this area, so try to experiment and find what works best for you.&nbsp; One interesting study concluded that students that took nature walk breaks outperformed students that took walks in an urban setting.&nbsp; If you have access to a nature walk, give it a shot.</p>

    <div><img width="64" height="64" src="/<?php print drupal_get_path('theme', 'successinc'); ?>/images/Ico%20Positive.png">
        <h4>Being positive</h4>
        <p>Ever wonder why self-help gurus always hammer this point?&nbsp; Well, the ever-expanding research on this topic shows that this may be a panacea to many of life’s ills.&nbsp; Positive thinking is correlated with improved performance in almost all facets of life - school, career, and even life expectancy.&nbsp; What does it actually mean to be positive?&nbsp; One of the most interesting ways we have seen this described is through the concept of a person’s default explanatory style.&nbsp; Optimists tend to explain unfortunate events as setbacks that can be remedied while pessimists view them as an inherent failure that will follow them through life.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a ton of fascinating research on this topic – if you are interested we recommend looking into the work of Dr. Seligman on Positive Psychology or Dr. Valliant’s work with Harvard’s Grant Study.</p>

    <h3>Bad study habits</h3>
    <div><img width="64" height="64" src="/<?php print drupal_get_path('theme', 'successinc'); ?>/images/Ico%20Underline.png">
        <h4>Spending significant time highlighting or underlining</h4>
        <p>Highlighting can actually be counter-productive.&nbsp; We really wish we had known this years ago before we used a bathtub worth of highlighting fluid during our time as a student.&nbsp; Highlighting, underlining, and rereading are all very passive approaches that have been used as a crutch for years.&nbsp; Instead, try to create flash cards – they actually work quite well.</p>
    </div>
    <div><img width="64" height="64" src="/<?php print drupal_get_path('theme', 'successinc'); ?>/images/Ico%20Multitask.png">
        <h4>Multitasking</h4>
        <p>In our opinion, the ability to multitask is one of the big jokes of our time.&nbsp; Doing several things inefficiently at once is a poor substitute for doing things efficiently one at a time.&nbsp; Being able to multitask has somehow become a badge of honor for people when almost no one can do it well.&nbsp; Studies show that multitasking can decrease performance by up to 40%!&nbsp; One such study to read to understand the cognitive implications of&nbsp; multitasking is a paper entitled “Executive Control of Cognitive Processes in Task Switching “ by Rubenstein, Meyer, and Evans.</p>

    <div><img width="64" height="64" src="/<?php print drupal_get_path('theme', 'successinc'); ?>/images/Ico%20No%20Music.png">
        <h4>Listening to music</h4>
        <p>This is a hotly debated topic.&nbsp; From the many studies we have sifted through, there doesn’t appear to be much evidence to support the benefits of music during studying.&nbsp; There are, however, indications that music can be a distraction and we therefor suggest skipping it all together.&nbsp; If you do decide to experiment with listening to music, we suggest avoiding popular music with fast beats.&nbsp; Instead, listen to musical scores with no lyrics.&nbsp; Basically, you should not consciously realize that music is playing in the background, otherwise it can be a distraction for you.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day, this is gray area, find what works for you.</p>

    <div><img width="64" height="64" src="/<?php print drupal_get_path('theme', 'successinc'); ?>/images/Ico%20Cramming.png">
        <h4>Cramming</h4>
        <p>Cramming does tend to produce short term results, however, the brain has a tendency to immediately “dump” the information shortly after the test.&nbsp; You will end up having to restudy the material to commit it to long term memory…which can be problematic for your Final Exams…&nbsp; Not to mention the fact that the material you are studying will most likely need to be used again in a more advanced course.</p>
    </div>
    <div><img width="64" height="64" src="/<?php print drupal_get_path('theme', 'successinc'); ?>/images/Ico%20bed.png">
        <h4>Studying in bed</h4>
        <p>When studying, you want to put your body into a receptive mode that is conducive to learning and retention.&nbsp; Getting too comfortable can be counterproductive and can make you drowsy while good posture can help you maintain alertness and enable you to study longer and more effectively.</p>
