<div class="grid_6">
    <div>
        <h4>Alternating study location</h4>
        <p>Changing location has shown a significant improvement in memory retention studies by cognitive scientists.  According to researchers, the brain associates material being learned with the studier's environment.  Varied environments allow the brain more opportunities to associate the material with something unique - which in turn increases the likelihood of retention.</p>

        <h4>Study multiple subjects during the same session</h4>
        <p>Think of this as athletics for your brain.  Elite athletes have been cross-training in multiple disciplines for years because of the proven benefits of varied activity.  Studies have shown that retention of study material improves dramatically when different parts of the brain are activated.   When the brain must use different approaches to solve problems, it is better prepared for the range of questions that a student is likely to encounter on a test.  Studies have shown that test takers can double their performance, and the results have been corroborated for both adults and children.  This is most effective if you study very different types of courses.  For example, alternating Spanish with Calculus is more effective than alternating Economics with Statistics because the latter subjects are more similar.</p>

        <h4>Ditching the phone</h4>
        <p>Did you know that research shows it takes people 25 minutes to rest after looking at their phone?  Your cell phone is your enemy when it comes to studying.  If you are like us, severing your electronic umbilical cord is extraordinarily tough to do.  If you have a smartphone, put it on airplane mode to avoid any distractions.  The texts and calls can wait…we promise.  PS - this goes for tablets, ipods, kindles, laptops, and anything else that will draw your attention away from the task at hand.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Taking breaks</h4>
        <p>This will ultimately be a personal preference.  A good rule of thumb is to study hard for 50 minutes, then take a 10 minute break.  You can then repeat the process for days that you need to study longer.  There is a lot of conflicting research in this area, so try to experiment and find what works best for you.  One interesting study concluded that students who took nature walk breaks outperformed students that took walks in an urban setting.  If you have access to a nature walk, give it a shot.</p>

        <h4>Spending significant time highlighting or underlining</h4>
        <p>Highlighting can actually be counter-productive.  This one would have been good to know before we had used a bathtub worth of highlighting fluid as a student.  Highlighting, underlining, and rereading are all very passive approaches that have been used as a crutch for years.  To be effective, you must translate the material into an active exercise.  For example, try to create flash cards – they actually work quite well.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Multitasking</h4>
        <p>In our opinion, the ability to multitask is one of the big jokes of our time.  Doing several things inefficiently at once is a poor substitute for doing one thing efficiently.  Being able to multitask has somehow become a badge of honor for people when almost no one can do it well.  Studies show that multitasking can decrease performance by up to 40%!  One such study to read to understand the cognitive implications of  multitasking is a paper entitled “Executive Control of Cognitive Processes in Task Switching “ by Rubenstein, Meyer, and Evans.</p>

        <h4>Listing to music</h4>
        <p>This is a hotly debated topic.  From the many studies we have sifted through, there doesn’t appear to be much evidence to support the benefits of music during studying.  It can, however, definitely be a distraction.  If you do decide to experiment with listening to music, we suggest avoiding popular music with fast beats.  Instead, listen to musical scores with no lyrics (we have a playlist that you can try when you check in to study).  If you choose to listen to music, you should not consciously realize the music is playing in the background, otherwise it is a distraction.   At the end of the day, this is gray area, find what works for you.</p>

    <div>
        <h4>Studying in bed</h4>
        <p>When studying, you want to put your body into a receptive mode that is conducive to learning and retention.  Getting too comfortable can be counterproductive and can make you drowsy.  Good posture helps you maintain alertness and enables you to study longer and more effectively.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Diet and exercise</h4>
        <p>Many studies show the link between diet/exercise and improved cognitive performance.  Taking care of your body by eating nutritious foods and exercising frequently helps contribute to a healthy brain.  Specifically, scientists see improvement in attention span, memory retention, and recall ability.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Study groups</h4>
        <p>Study groups can be a helpful tool, but are often misused.  Here are a couple of things to consider.  First, when forming your group, try to keep the group to 3-6 people in most instances.  Larger groups tend to lose focus and lead to diminished results.  Second, group study tends to take much longer than individual study, so make sure you and the group are focused and have explicit goals defined for the study session.  Third, prepare for your group study sessions before you show up.  Having specific questions for the other group members and/or teaching the other group members concepts that you have already studied will help you better learn the material.</p>

        <h4>Sleep</h4>
        <p>Sleep is a critical component to brain health and academic performance.  The average adult needs 7-9 hours of sleep, while the average teenager needs 9-9 1/2 hours.  In addition to this quantity of sleep, the quality of sleep is also extremely important.  If you are struggling with sleep, we recommend checking out the Sleep Foundation for some really helpful tips.</p>
