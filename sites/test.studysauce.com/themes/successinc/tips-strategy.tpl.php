        <h4>Being positive</h4>
        <p>Ever wonder why self-help gurus always hammer this point?  The ever-expanding research on this topic shows that this may be a panacea to many of life’s ills.  Positive thinking is correlated with improved performance in almost all facets of life - school, career, and even life expectancy.  What does it actually mean to be positive?  One of the most interesting ways we have seen this described is through the concept of a person’s default explanatory style.  Optimists tend to explain unfortunate events as setbacks that can be remedied while pessimists view them as an inherent failure that will follow them through life.   There is a ton of fascinating research on this topic – if you are interested we recommend looking into the work of Dr. Seligman on Positive Psychology or Dr. Valliant’s work with Harvard’s Grant Study.</p>

        <h4>Ask for help</h4>
        <p>You will be surprised by how many people are willing to help you.  Your school wants you to do well and almost certainly has tons of resources dedicated to helping you succeed.  Often times there are tutors available and/or subject-specific resources for students that simply ask.</p>

        <h4>Active vs passive learning</h4>
        <p>This one is critical.  When studying, one of your primary goals should be to move from passive to active learning.  Think of passive learning as receiving information while active learning is interacting with the information to understand it more deeply.  Passive learning can be characterized as thinking of the student as an empty vessel waiting for knowledge to be transferred by the teacher.   Symptoms of passive learning can include: rote memorization of material, making detailed notes of lectures that accept everything said at face value, or simply reading the assigned material.  Active learning seeks to improve understanding of material by encouraging critical thinking.  Examples include: asking thought-provoking questions about the material to understand how things are related, why the student thinks the teacher has chosen this particular exercise/reading, or encouraging students to think about both sides of an argument.</p>

        <h4>Spaced repetition</h4>
        <p>For classes with a lot of memorization, spaced repetition can work wonders.  Simply put, by revisiting the material you are trying to remember at defined intervals, you greatly increase your chance of retaining the information.  Our study plans incorporate this study strategy and will build out a schedule for you.  We highly recommend either writing flashcards by hand, or using an online tool like Anki.</p>

        <h4>Active reading</h4>
        <p>How often do you find yourself reading when suddenly you realize that you have no idea what you have been covering?  In order to get the most out of reading, you must move from passive reading to active reading.  Specifically, prime your brain by asking questions before you get started.  What else was happening during the time period of this reading?    Why has this reading been selected at this time in the course?  By doing so, you will then be more curious about the material and will pay closer attention.  At the end of your reading, try to summarize the main points by writing them down or by speaking them out loud.  This is a great way to check how much you have learned.</p>

        <h4>Teaching to learn</h4>
        <p>Have you ever taken a foreign language class and realized how much more difficult it is to speak than to simply read the language?  This is because you must understand the information at a much deeper level.  To speak, you must create the information in your mind and then verbalize it to someone else in a way that makes sense.  Similarly, by teaching someone else, you are forcing yourself to explain a concept at a much deeper level.  By doing so, you greatly improve both your understanding of the topic as well as improving your overall retention of the subject.</p>

        <h4>Setting up goals</h4>
        <p>Goal setting is a terrific way to improve your performance.  Research shows that by simply saying a goal aloud, you are more likely to achieve it!  Try to set goals that stretch you to perform better than you otherwise would.  We also suggest setting three types of goals - behavioral goals for how many hours to study per week, interim goals for grades that you would like to achieve throughout the term, and finally the overall outcome goal of a grade point average.  Check out our Goals tab to set up yours.</p>

        <h4>Accountability partner</h4>
        <p>Take your goal setting to the next level by holding yourself accountable to someone else.  By sharing your goals with an accountability partner, you will further motivate yourself to achieve the goals you establish.  Finding a good accountability partner is crucial.
